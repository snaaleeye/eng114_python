# A lambda function is a small anonymous function.
# A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.
# x = lambda a : a + 10 print(x(5))

# def add(num1, num2):
#     return num1 + num2
#
#
# addition = lambda num1, num2: num1 + num2
#
# print(add(2, 2))
# print(addition(2, 2))

# Lambda is useful within transformational blocks
# so self-contained you cannot grab it later
#
# savings = [234.00, 555,00, 674.00, 78.00]

# bonus = list(map(lambda x: x * 1.1, savings))

# print(bonus)
